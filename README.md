Image searching mini CGI project.
Extracts RGB, HSV, LUV color histogram, and Gabor(Grayscale), DCNN(VGG16) features from the image dataset and saves it to .npy file.
Then uses it to calculate the similarity between the query image and the rest of the database.
CGI script shows the search results after sorting the images based on the similarity.
